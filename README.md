letterpy
========

Work in Progress: Letterpress (iOS App) helper in Python, uses Wolfram-Alpha API


Due to an XML-parser-error and the shitty library I used there are many entries missing.


To start, just run `python words.py charset` with Python 2 (tested on 2.7.6).


Feel free to use your own Wolfram-API-key instead of mine. It's free. Please :)
